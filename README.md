# StatsReview
A second brain that keeps all the stats knowledge I am reviewing (or learning)

Review for Regression:
- OLS estimators & Gaussian-Markov Assumption (why we need them)

Review for hypothesis testing:
- One-sample z-test: basic of hypothesis testing, effect size, and power (https://kefangpsych.github.io/StatsReview/one-sample_z-test)
