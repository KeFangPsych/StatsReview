# StatsReview
A second brain that keeps all the stats knowledge I am reviewing (or learning)

Review for Estimation Theory:

- What are estimators: How sample mean and variance can be understood as estimators

- OLS estimators of regression & Gaussian-Markov Assumption (why we need them)

Review for Inference Theory:
- One-sample z-test: basic of hypothesis testing, effect size, and power (https://kefangpsych.github.io/StatsReview/one-sample_z-test)

In inference, the trio - hypothesis testing, effect size, and power analysis - all super important and super connected. I put together this handy guide because I noticed something kinda off about the way we usually learn statistics. Based on the statistical training experience I had, courses leave power analysis for dessert, like it's an afterthought. Problem is, that makes it harder to get how it fits in with everything else, especially when you dive into the complicated models that involves juggling a bunch of tests at once. So, what I've done here is stick to the basics. Think of it as a training wheels: we're going to focus on the simplest type of hypothesis testing, the one-sample Z-test. I'll walk through it step-by-step, breaking down the math stuff so it's easier to digest with the aim to not just understand the what, but the why and how with formal language of math. I wrote this guide as it is always my hope to learn stats in a more rigorous 'mathy' way while also keeping it intuitive and accessible. And I believe that bring big theoretical concepts like power to a simple example can sometimes be the best way to learn. It's like building a toy house before you actually build the real house - once you've got the fundamentals nailed, everything else kind of falls into place. So I hope this guide provide the logic and math detail behind the concepts in a way that's way less intimidating and way more fun.
