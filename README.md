# StatsReview
A second brain that keeps all the stats knowledge I am reviewing (or learning)

Review for Estimation Theory:
- OLS estimators of regression & Gaussian-Markov Assumption (why we need them)

Review for Inference Theory:
- One-sample z-test: basic of hypothesis testing, effect size, and power (https://kefangpsych.github.io/StatsReview/one-sample_z-test)
This guide is designed to offer a panoramic view of the intricate relationship among three fundamental pillars of statistics: hypothesis testing, effect size, and power analysis. My motivation for developing this guide stems from an oversight in the statistical training I received, where power analysis was frequently deferred to the final few sessions of the curriculum. This delayed coverage significantly impedes our ability to comprehend its interrelation with the foundational concepts of hypothesis testing and effect size, particularly as more complex models typically involve multiple tests, thereby clouding intuition. To navigate this issue, this guide intentionally employs the most elementary form of hypothesis testing—the one-sample Z-test—as its primary example. By meticulously deconstructing the mathematical nuances behind it, the guide aims not only to elucidate these concepts but also to present them in a logically coherent sequence. It is my hope that this strategic simplification will make these fundamental statistical concepts more accessible and relatable, providing a robust foundation for those further topics in statistical inference.
